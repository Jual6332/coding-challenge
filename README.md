# Ambassador Coding Challenge

Our coding challenge is your opportunity to demonstrate your experience, skills, and aptitude by building a prototype of the webâ€™s most minimal referral automation software.

## Alvey's Application
I'll be developing a full-stack application as instructed. Code was initially wrote on my public repo: https://github.com/Jual6332/legendary_referral_list and is available there as well. I initially built a ToDo application using Django and JavaScript to prepare for this submission that I repurposed for the solution. You'll find a lot of the code asks for a model 'todo' that could easily be renamed 'referral_link' if I had extra time in the configuration stage of this project. 

## Problem Statement:

## Proposed Solution:
- My solution focuses on the full-stack.
- A REST Api will be built that allows for CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations. This will feature a minimal backend, Browsable Api.
- A client-side app will be created for user interface that has is easy-to-use. 

## Technical Choices: 
### Python for back-end development
- Python is fairly easy to learn and a language I already new.
- Python has a rich community of developers.
- An in-demand skill in industry.

#### Django framework
- I have a decent understanding of the MTV architectural pattern and would like to challenge myself for this project.
- "The framework for perfectionists with deadlines."
- I'm excited to build an API with Django.

### VanillaJS for front-end development
- I decided to go with "normal" JavaScript ES6 for simplicity. Basic idea for JS ES6 is write less, do more. 
- There was no requirement for real-time rendering (virtual DOM), otherwise I would have to go with ReactJS.

## Tradeoffs: 
- Editing a link deletes the old link and provides a new one. This results in the counter dropping down to 0 clicks. This made the most sense to me, as I saw the referral changing as an entirely new referral. 
- I developed the front-end with Vanilla JS. In the future I'd like to implement ReactJS components to show an even more in-depth full-stack competency.
- I perscribe to the Pythonic pillar that if you have two solutions that both accomplish the task: one complicated and one simple, choose the simple solution. 

## Heroku Deployment:
