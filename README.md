# Ambassador Coding Challenge

Our coding challenge is your opportunity to demonstrate your experience, skills, and aptitude by building a prototype of the webâ€™s most minimal referral automation software.

## Alvey's Application
Minimal edit. Code was initially wrote on my public repo: https://github.com/Jual6332/legendary_referral_list

## Problem Statement:

## Proposed Solution:
- 

## Technical Choices: 
### Python for back-end development
- Python is fairly easy to learn and a language I already new.
- Python has a rich community of developers.

#### Django framework
- 

### VanillaJS for front-end development
- I decided to go with "normal" JavaScript ES6 for simplicity. Basic idea for JS ES6 is write less, do more. 
- There was no requirement for real-time rendering (virtual DOM), otherwise I would have to go with ReactJS.


## Tradeoffs: 

## Heroku Deployment:
